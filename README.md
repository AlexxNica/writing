Why another Markdown editor ?
----
There are many online editors that support Markdown but:
* most of them don't support LaTeX / MathJax (for math formulas)
* some of them do, but have a 1-sec delay between keypress and display, and I find this annoying, StackEdit
* some of them have annoying flickering each time you write new text, once math is present on the page, 

That's why I decided to make **Writing**:

* open-source
* no server needed, you can run it offline
* fast rendering (no delay when writing / no math equations flickering)
* **just what you need: write, preview, save the code (CTRL+M), save as PDF (CTRL+P), and nothing else**
* LPWP website, a.k.a. "Landing Page=Working Page", i.e. the first page that you visit on the website is the page *where things actually happen*, that means that there is no annoying welcome page or login page, etc.
